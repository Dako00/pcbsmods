## Level 25 Save for PC Building Simulator
A level 25 save game with 15 million in the bank in case you want to try out building things but for some reason prefer career mode to freebuild.
Saved on PCBS v0.8.10.0, might be compatible with later versions though.

## Install
1. Find your save directory (usually Steam\steamapps\common\PC Building Simulator\Saves)
2. Copy the save (save2.binary) to your save directory, if you have a save with the same name already, just rename this save before copying

## Notes
The 15 million in the bank do not display properly due to the game UI not being wide enough.
