## Order Templates & Customer Specs combined for PC Building Simulator

## Order Templates
Changes the PC Shop (Bits&PCs). Allows you to save your current shopping cart as a template that you can recall later. Useful for recurring builds where 90% of the parts are the same.

How to use:
1. Go to your PC and open the Shop app
2. Add the items you wish to have as a template to your shopping cart
3. Go to the shopping cart, scroll down to the part where it says "Order Templates" and enter a template name
4. Click "Save As Template"

For every template there should be 3 buttons: 
	- "Restore" to clear out the current shopping cart and add all the items from the template instead 
	- "Add from" to add the template items to the current shopping cart
	- "Remove" to remove the template
