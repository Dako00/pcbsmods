## All Random Jobs Available for Max Level for PC Building Simulator
Makes all the low level random jobs that disappear as you level up in career mode available again up to the maximum level (currently 25).
!! IF YOU USE MY REMOVE BENCHMARK UPGRADE JOBS MOD MAKE SURE TO INSTALL THAT ONE AFTER THIS ONE, OTHERWISE THIS WILL RESET THE MAX LEVELS !!

## Install
1. Extract all files in the archive to the main directory of PC Building Simulator
2. Run MaxLevelAllRandomJobsInstall.cmd
3. If the patching has been successful you can start the game (no exceptions displayed in the log plus it should say "Done" somewhere)

## Notes
Tested on PC Building Simulator version 0.9.0.0, but it should usually work on other versions since it patches text assets by asset name and modifies only the part of the asset that actually needs to be changed. No guarantees are made since asset names as well as asset content can change on other versions which may make the patcher unable to recognize what to change, or to change something that is not supposed to be changed!
Uses unitypatcher (requires JRE 8 or higher) to modify the assets file. Should be compatible with all other mods that only patch their assets partially.
