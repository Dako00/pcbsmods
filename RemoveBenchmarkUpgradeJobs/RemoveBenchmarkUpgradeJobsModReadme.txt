## Remove Benchmark Upgrade Jobs
I've seen a lot of people complain about all those benchmark jobs in career mode where you have to upgrade the PC to reach a certain 3D Mark score. Complaints were usually that they lose money 99% of the time and thus just reject all those jobs alltogether because of that. If you can identify with that then this mod is for you, since it simply sets the minimum and maximum levels of those jobs to 0, effectively removing them from the game!
!! IF YOU USE MY LEVEL 20 ALL RANDOM JOBS MOD MAKE SURE TO INSTALL THAT ONE FIRST, OTHERWISE IT WILL RESET THE MAX LEVELS !!

## Install
1. Extract all files in the archive to the main directory of PC Building Simulator
2. Run RemoveBenchmarkUpgradeJobsInstall.cmd
3. If the patching has been successful you can start the game (no exceptions displayed in the log plus it should say "Done" somewhere)

## Notes
Tested on PC Building Simulator version 0.8.3.2, but it should usually work on other versions since it patches text assets by asset name and modifies only the part of the asset that actually needs to be changed. No guarantees are made since asset names as well as asset content can change on other versions which may make the patcher unable to recognize what to change, or to change something that is not supposed to be changed!
Uses unitypatcher (requires JRE 8 or higher) to modify the assets file. Should be compatible with all other mods that only patch their assets partially.
